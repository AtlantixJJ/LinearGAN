"""Contains the base class for encoder in a GAN model.

In addition to the two-player game between generator and discriminator in GANs,
some work introduce an extra encoder to facilitate real image inference. The
encoder can be view as the reverse of the generator, which projects a given
image back to the latent space. This kind of work is also widely known as `GAN
Inversion`.

This class is derived from the `BaseModule` class defined in `base_module.py`.
